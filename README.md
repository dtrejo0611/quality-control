# Visual Inspection GUI (PyQt5 + OpenCV)

This project is a small visual-inspection application built with PyQt5 and OpenCV. It provides a GUI to capture or load images, select Regions of Interest (ROIs) for two types of tests (color matching and template/presence matching), and run a simple pass/fail test that highlights results on the test image.
